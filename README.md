## ðŸ’¾ Dataset

A small SQLite database created in-memory with a single table called `sales`.  
The structure of the table is:

| Column   | Type    | Description              |
|----------|---------|--------------------------|
| id       | INTEGER | Primary key              |
| product  | TEXT    | Name of the product      |
| quantity | INTEGER | Number of units sold     |
| price    | REAL    | Price per unit           |

Sample data is inserted through Python code.

    SUM(quantity * price) AS revenue 
FROM sales 
GROUP BY product;
````
