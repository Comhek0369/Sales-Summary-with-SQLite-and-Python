# ðŸ“Š Sales Summary with SQLite and Python

This project demonstrates how to use **SQLite**, **SQL**, and **Python** to perform basic sales data analysis and visualize the results using a bar chart.

## ðŸ§° Tools & Libraries Used

- `sqlite3` â€“ manage SQLite database
- `pandas` â€“ data manipulation
- `matplotlib` â€“ data visualization
- `Jupyter Notebook` â€“ code execution and output

## ðŸ’¾ Dataset

A small SQLite database created in-memory with a single table called `sales`.  
The structure of the table is:

| Column   | Type    | Description              |
|----------|---------|--------------------------|
| id       | INTEGER | Primary key              |
| product  | TEXT    | Name of the product      |
| quantity | INTEGER | Number of units sold     |
| price    | REAL    | Price per unit           |

Sample data is inserted through Python code.

## ðŸ“ˆ SQL Query Used

```sql
SELECT 
    product, 
    SUM(quantity) AS total_qty, 
    SUM(quantity * price) AS revenue 
FROM sales 
GROUP BY product;
````

## ðŸ“Ž File
- ðŸ“˜ [SQL Script: SQLite_Database.sql](./SQLite%20Database%20.ipynb)â€” The notebook containing all the code and outputs

| ðŸ“Œ | ![Screenshot](./sales_chart.png) â€” The revenue chart image

## âœ… Outcome
By completing this project, you:

Learned how to run SQL queries inside Python

Performed simple data aggregation

Created your first product revenue visualization
